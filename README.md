# Folded-Dipole-Antenna Using CST

###### Designed and simulated a Folded Dipole Antenna using CST Studio Suite, optimized for improved impedance matching and bandwidth compared to a conventional dipole. The model was parameterized for length, gap, radius, and spacing, allowing flexibility in tuning for desired frequency operation. Simulation analysis included return loss, VSWR, and radiation pattern to validate performance. This project enhanced my understanding of advanced antenna structures and their applications in wireless communication systems.
